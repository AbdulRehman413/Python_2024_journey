# FOUR TYPES OF VARIABLES 
# a can store integer (any numbers)
# b can store boolean (any true or false)
# c can store String (names or words)
# d can store none data type ?
#list1 = collections of different data types 
#mutable and non mutable means can be changed or cannot be 
#changable is list1 
#non changable is tuple1 
#if u want to create a code that can be changed later , use (list1)
#if u want a code that should not be changed , use (tuple1)
#mapped command(dict1) = to store someones information with a collection of data types 
#floor division operator : if dont want multiple values in the answer 
#module opaerator: just the percentage %
#for square root :  use double ** (25**3)
#the coversion of one data type into another data type is called type casting

#  print(int(a) + int(b)) if string has integers . than use this command  


#  to count character in a string and to execute it 
#  use     (for character in "")
#  a = ("niggagigga ")
# for character in a 
# print(character)

# this will count the numbers and execute them

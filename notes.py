# \n(esacpe sequence character) : for making more than one statement above and down
# To comment and uncomment use (#) and to automatically comment/uncomment 
# then use the shortcut ctrl + /
# '''
# nigga gigga
# wassup
# biuuuuuuu
# '''
# triple "single" commas to not execute the statement
# just write the statement in bewteen the commas 
# """ is also applicable  
# if want to highlight or want to write  something in inverted commas 
# use the syntax \" and keep on
# we can also put single inverted commas 
#just use the same \'
# separator syntax (sep="..") use any symbol to separate characters
# end syntax (end="...") use to add something consistently at the end of code
# FOUR TYPES OF VARIABLES 
# a can store integer (any numbers)
# b can store boolean (any true or false)
# c can store String (names or words)
# d can store none data type ?
#list1 = collections of different data types 
#mutable and non mutable means can be changed or cannot be 
#changable is list1 
#non changable is tuple1 
#if u want to create a code that can be changed later , use (list1)
#if u want a code that should not be changed , use (tuple1)
#mapped command(dict1) = to store someones information with a collection of data types 
#floor division operator : if dont want multiple values in the answer 
#module opaerator: just the percentage %
#for square root :  use double * (25*3)
#the coversion of one data type into another data type is called type casting

#  print(int(a) + int(b)) if string has integers . than use this command  


#  to count character in a string and to execute it 
#  use     (for character in "")
#  a = ("niggagigga ")
# for character in a 
# print(character)

# this will count the numbers and execute thema = ("pneumonoultramicrosilicovolcanoconiosis")


# for character in a:
#     print(character)
#     print(a[12])
#     print(a[11])
#     print(a[1])
#     print(a[3])


# if a character has for example 12 words and we want only four \n we will write like [print(character name[0:5])]


# for negative slicing , first count the characters of string and put the ratio of numbers of (-) how many u want to execute
#if we wanna guess what answer we will get , subtract the counted number with the wanted ratio
#strings are immutable= non changeable

#print(a.upper()) to convert the string into uppercase letters
#print(a.lower()) to convert string into lowecase letters
#print(a.rstrip()) puts symbols at the beginnning or end of string 
#for example if we want to end every statement with full stop(.) , we can just put (print(a.rstrip()))
#print(a.replace("  ", "  ")) replace one string with another
#print(b.split(" ")) creates gap bewteen strings and convert it to separate components
#print(c.capitalize()) converts only first letter of string into uppercase and converts else into lowercase
#print(c.center(integers)) creates space at the beginning of strings how many length as we wants
#print(a.count()) counts how many times a sring is repeating in a statement
#print(a.endswith("symbol")) shows true or false if a string is ending with the symbol we listed in the code
#print(a.find("anything")) shows if the mentioned word is present in a string and only shows the number where mentioned string is present
#print(a.index("anything")) is same as the print(a.find("anything"))
#print(d.isalnum()) returns true if (a-z, A-Z , 0-9) are present in a string else returns false
#print(d.isalpha()) returns false (a-z, A-Z , 0-9) , its only accepts (a-z, A-Z ) and will return true on this 
#print(d.islower()) returns true if all the letters in strings are true else returns false
#print(d.isprintable()) returns true if the string has all printable characters and returns false if string has non printable character (eg. \n)
#print(d.ispace()) returns true if strings has spaces and false if string doesnt have spaces 
#print(d.istitle()) returns true if first letter of each strings is capital
#print(d.isupper()) Return True if the string is an uppercase string, False otherwise.
#print(a.startswith(".")) returns true if string starts with the mentioned symbol or letter
#print(d.swapcase()) converts uppercase into lowecase and lowercase into uppercase
#print(b.title()) converts the every first letter of string into capital

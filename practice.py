# \n(esacpe sequence character) : for making more than one statement above and down
# To comment and uncomment use (#) and to automatically comment/uncomment 
# then use the shortcut ctrl + /
# '''
# nigga gigga
# wassup
# biuuuuuuu
# '''
# triple "single" commas to not execute the statement
# just write the statement in bewteen the commas 
# """ is also applicable  
# if want to highlight or want to write  something in inverted commas 
# use the syntax \" and keep on
# we can also put single inverted commas 
#just use the same \'
# separator syntax (sep="..") use any symbol to separate characters
# end syntax (end="...") use to add something consistently at the end of code
# FOUR TYPES OF VARIABLES 
# a can store integer (any numbers)
# b can store boolean (any true or false)
# c can store String (names or words)
# d can store none data type ?
#list1 = collections of different data types 
#mutable and non mutable means can be changed or cannot be 
#changable is list1 
#non changable is tuple1 
#if u want to create a code that can be changed later , use (list1)
#if u want a code that should not be changed , use (tuple1)
#mapped command(dict1) = to store someones information with a collection of data types 
#floor division operator : if dont want multiple values in the answer 
#module opaerator: just the percentage %
#for square root :  use double * (25*3)
#the coversion of one data type into another data type is called type casting

#  print(int(a) + int(b)) if string has integers . than use this command  


#  to count character in a string and to execute it 
#  use     (for character in "")
#  a = ("niggagigga ")
# for character in a 
# print(character)

# this will count the numbers and execute thema = ("pneumonoultramicrosilicovolcanoconiosis")


# for character in a:
#     print(character)
#     print(a[12])
#     print(a[11])
#     print(a[1])
#     print(a[3])


# if a character has for example 12 words and we want only four \n we will write like [print(character name[0:5])]


# for negative slicing , first count the characters of string and put the ratio of numbers of (-) how many u want to execute
#if we wanna guess what answer we will get , subtract the counted number with the wanted ratio
#strings are immutable= non changeable
